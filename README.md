## Academic Works

### 1. Lower Bounds on a Memory-Constrained Bidirectional Enumerator
Research project initiated during my internship at **LaBRI**, supervised by [**Mr. Raskin**](https://users.mccme.ru/raskin/), a searcher at LaBRI.

The objective is to establish a **lower bound** for bidirectional enumeration problems under memory constraints, particularly for **unidirectional data structures** such as hash chains.

### 2. Coordination et exactitude dans les systèmes distribués *(ongoing)*
Academic work in **Epistemology**, nearing completion.  
The project will be published as a public repository once finalized.
