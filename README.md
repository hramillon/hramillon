## Guide Tour for Master's Jury

This repository presents my academic and personal work, mainly focused on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Theoretical Computer Science**.

## AI Projects, Timeline

### 1. Image Recognition
Introduction to deep learning fundamentals and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
The project focuses on pattern recognition in images, with a final objective: **recognizing my cat**, which is intentionally excluded from the training set to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize.

### 2. Natural Language Processing
Introduction to **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and advanced cells such as **LSTM** and **GRU**.

Projects include:
- A sentence generator using GRUs
- A **French → English translator**, introducing:
  - Attention mechanisms
  - Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

### 3. Reinforcement Learning *(README not published yet)*
Introduction to reinforcement learning and deep learning-based control algorithms.  
The final objective is inspired by **DeepMind (2013)**: building an AI capable of playing games using **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

### 4. Image Generation — Cat Generator *(ongoing)*
Introduction to **Autoencoders (AE)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**.  
The goal is to generate realistic images of cats using latent space representations.

## Academic Works

### 1. Lower Bounds on a Memory-Constrained Bidirectional Enumerator
Research project initiated during my internship at **LaBRI**, supervised by **Mr. Raskin**.

The objective is to establish a **lower bound** for bidirectional enumeration problems under memory constraints, particularly for **unidirectional data structures** such as hash chains.

### 2. Coordination et exactitude dans les systèmes distribués *(ongoing)*
Academic work in **Epistemology**, nearing completion.  
The project will be published as a public repository once finalized.
